The QRL [`qrysm`](https://github.com/theqrl/qrysm) package contains scripts that allow for running a small local testnet using Kurtosis. This script will launch 2 beacon nodes, 2 validator clients and 2 gzond execution clients.

 This setup can be useful for testing and development.


 ## Installation

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Verify that Docker has been successfully installed by running `sudo docker run hello-world`.

1. Install [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/). Verify that Kurtosis has been successfully installed by running `kurtosis version` which should display the version.

1. Install [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). If you are on Ubuntu, you can install `yq` by running `snap install yq`.

1. Download the QRL qrysm Package using GitHub. `git clone https://github.com/theqrl/qrysm`. The startup scripts and Kurtosis configuration files can be found in `qrysm/scripts/local_testnet` directory.

## Building and Running



Running `qrysm/scripts/local_testnet/start_local_testnet.sh` will build the `gzond` execution node, `qrysm` consensus node, and `qrysm` validator node binaries, will generate the genesis information and bootstrap everything together.

LEGEND:
[1] Validator API: Validator Client connects to its Consensus Node.
[2] Engine API:    Consensus and Execution nodes are bidirectionally linked.
[3] Consensus P2P: Consensus nodes connect to each other to agree on chain state.
[4] Execution P2P: Execution nodes connect to each other to gossip transactions.

:::info Configuration Options
This script will reference the configuration options declared in `qrysm/scripts/local_testnet/network_params.yml`. For a full reference to all configuration options and additional functions see the [Kurtosis guide](/testnet/usage/kurtosis).
:::


To start a testnet, from the Qrysm root repository:

```bash
cd ./scripts/local_testnet
./start_local_testnet.sh
```
You will see a list of services running and "Started!" at the end. The private network is running and blocks are syncing.


To view all running services:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect local-testnet
```

To view the logs:

```bash
kurtosis service logs local-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

:::info
Kurtosis also comes with a web UI which can be open with `kurtosis web`.
:::

Some testnet parameters can be varied by modifying the `network_params.yaml` file. The full configuration reference for kurtosis is specified [here](https://github.com/theQRL/zond-package?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).


## Stopping the testnet

To stop the testnet, from the Qrysm root repository:

```bash
cd ./scripts/local_testnet
./stop_local_testnet.sh
```

This will stop all running docker services, distroy the local enclave and stop the Kurtosis engine. Once complete you will see "Local testnet stopped.". 


## CLI options

The script comes with some CLI options, which can be viewed with `./start_local_testnet.sh --help`. 

One of the CLI options is to avoid rebuilding Qrysm each time the testnet starts, which can be configured with the command:

```bash
./start_local_testnet.sh -b false
```
